. it is a structural design pattern
. suppose we have parent p and child c1 and c2 , if we want an object to have both properties of c1 and c2 then we can go for decorator pattern
eg: if we have a car parent and sports car , luxury car children, if we want a car that needs to have properties of both sports car and luxury car
at the same time ,we need to go for decorator pattern.
. the decorator takes the base class and wraps the decoration logic according to other classes, eg
if we have a base pizza and we having topping decorator which has multiple toppings like cheese, mushroom , jalapeno etc

then we can take a base pizza and have cheese , mushroom , cheese, jalapeno added
we can have some of the few posssiblilites as :
    base pizza + cheese
    base pizza + cheese + mushroom
    base pizza + cheese + mushroom + cheese + jalapeno
    base pizza + jalapeno
    base pizza + jalapeno + cheese
