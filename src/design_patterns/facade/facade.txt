. it is a structural design pattern
. it is used to hide the complex system logic , and provide an interface to the client , through which the client can
  access the system.
. facade takes the responsibility of initializing all the required objects
. if any other step comes for eg: in create order if any other step gets added, then we only need to add that step in
 facade layer, it takes care of creating order

. we are hiding the internal details to client, just we are exposing the method , and the facade takes care of getting
all the objects and doing the job (like creating order)

. one facade can use other facades also.(eg: orderfacade, paymentfacade etc)
