. it is a creational design pattern
. it is used to configure complex objects
. whenever we have a complex object, and we want to provide only specific fields to constructor it is difficult,
 so it is better to use builder pattern
. we have 4 components
 . product
 . builder interface
 . concrete builder --> there are many concrete builders implementing the builder
 . director
. director uses the concrete builder to generate the final object


. Builder design pattern also helps in minimizing the number of parameters in the constructor and
  thus there is no need to pass in null for optional parameters to the constructor.
